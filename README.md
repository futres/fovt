# FuTRES Ontology of Vertebrate Traits (FOVT)

This ontology is to map measurable vertebrate traits. We leverage the BioCollections Ontology ([BCO](http://purl.obofoundry.org/ontology/bco.owl)) to link observations of individual specimens to their trait values. Traits are defined in the Ontology of Biological Attributes ([OBA](http://purl.obofoundry.org/ontology/oba.owl)).

More information on the ontology can be found at http://obofoundry.org/ontology/fovt (once ontology is registered).

More information on FuTRES is available at https://futres.org/.
